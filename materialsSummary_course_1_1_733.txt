Tadeusz Kościuszko was a Polish army officer and statesman who gained fame for his role in the American Revolution and his leadership of a national insurrection in his homeland. He was born to a family of noble origin and was educated in military and civil architecture and painting. He joined the colonial forces fighting for independence from the British and was given the rank of engineer colonel. He was given U.S. citizenship and was made a brigadier general in the U.S. Army. When the Russian army invaded Poland in 1792, Kościuszko rose to fame as a division commander and was granted honorary French citizenship. He was delegated to Paris to seek support for the Polish cause and returned to Poland to lead a national uprising against the occupying powers. He issued the Manifesto of Połaniec, suspending serfdom and reducing villein service. He managed to use the city population to build earthworks and to defend the city alongside the regular army. After suffering a defeat at Maciejowice, he was taken prisoner and the uprising collapsed. He was freed by the emperor Paul I and returned to the United States. After Napoleon's fall in 1814, the Russian emperor Alexander I sought Kościuszko's help in bargaining for Poland's territories, but Kościuszko proposed unrealistic conditions. He died in 1817 and his remains were buried in the cathedral in Kraków.
